      The National Legislative Development Project (NLD Project) was designed, in collaboration with the Vietnamese government, to address the issues of quality, consistency and transparency in the law-making process and to make legislation more enforceable and effective. In particular, the project examines four core components of the law-making process: (1) Planning; (2) Policy Development; (3) Legislative Drafting; and (4) Legal System Coherence.&nbsp; The project is funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD).

    <p>
      In order to support the Ministry of Justice to carry out the new task, which was assigned by the Decision 921/QD-TTg dated 12 June 2013 of the Prime Minister, NLD Project will support the development of software to manage and monitor the promulgation of LNDs. The software is a web application system, that enable legal drafters, planners and managers to write legal documents (collaborative writing), by consulting and referencing other legal documents (document management) according to the legal obligations (workflow) while being able to report their activity (project management) in a timely manner. The main content is about the implementation of a tracking tool for the process of drafting of legal normative document (LNDs). In the phase one it encompasses the tracking of law and ordinance implementing legal normative documents at the central level.&nbsp; In the future (phase 2), this application will have to support the monitor of all legal normative documents at the central level and law and ordinance implementing legal normative documents at the local level.
    </p>
    <p>
     In phase 1 of the project (support the tracking law and ordinance implementing legal normative documents at central level), for each type of legal normative documents of the system, we must be able to track which agency it belongs to, who is assigned to work on it, what step a document is now rendered at. The tool should enable drafting agencies to develop detailed plans and monitor the development of Legal Normative Documents (LNDs) against the plans to ensure timely issuance of sufficient LNDs to meet the requirements for the implementation of laws and ordinances and law and ordinance making agenda.
